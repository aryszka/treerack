[whitespace]
1. merge whitespaces
2. set ws to alias
3. apply whitespace to expressions
- a a -> a ws* a
- a | b -> a | b
- a? -> a{0, 1} -> a{0, 1}
- a+ -> a{1,} -> a (ws* a){,}
- a* -> a{0,} -> (a (ws* a){,}){,}
- root -> ws* root ws*

error reporting
- longest parse
- count the lines
- print the line
- print the deepest non-alias node name
- print the documentation of the node name
